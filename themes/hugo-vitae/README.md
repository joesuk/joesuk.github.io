# Vitae

... is a feature-rich yet minimalistic blog theme for Hugo that **focuses on your content**.

## History

After [Benedikt(aka dataCobra)](https://github.com/dataCobra/hugo-vitae) lost interest in further maintaining Vitae, I took over. I got permission from him to use the same branding. My main motivation for maintaining this theme is that I use it myself in my personal blogs, both English and Persian.

## Websites using Vitae

You can do a PR to add your website here. It'll be added as long as they aren't illegal or they don't
have NSFW inside.

## Features

See FEATURES.md

## Feature requests

Please kindly open an issue. I would implement it when I've got some free time, given that it's a reasonable feature.

## Donations

Donations are welcome in the form of Bitcoin Cash. You can send any amount to this Bitcoin Cash address:

```
bitcoincash:qzxftuwttw4ru9pa8ffw3ssl6w8g2gl95vh54daadq
```

If you have other cryptocurrencies, you can swap them into Bitcoin Cash. **Note that Bitcoin Cash(BCH) is NOT Bitcoin(BTC). Sending Bitcoin to a Bitcoin Cash address will result in permanent lose of funds.**

You could also donate to Codeberg for their code and static web hosting.
